Create a technical implementation plan for a feature. Read the spec at `.specify/specs/$ARGUMENTS/spec.md` and create a `plan.md` in the same directory.

The plan must include:
- Technical context (language, dependencies, frameworks)
- Constitution check (verify compliance with all principles)
- Project structure showing files to create/modify
- Architecture overview
- Data model (create `data-model.md` alongside)
- Implementation strategy with phased approach

Also generate `data-model.md` and any `contracts/` API specifications as needed.
