Review a feature spec for ambiguities and resolve them. Read `.specify/specs/$ARGUMENTS/spec.md` and find all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers. For each one, either:

1. Ask the user for clarification
2. Propose a reasonable default with justification
3. Research the codebase for context that resolves the ambiguity

Update the spec with resolved clarifications, removing the markers and replacing them with concrete requirements.

Feature to clarify: $ARGUMENTS
