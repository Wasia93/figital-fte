Create a new feature specification. First, determine the next feature number by checking `.specify/specs/` for existing features. Then create a new directory `.specify/specs/NNN-feature-name/` and write a `spec.md` file following the template at `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`.

The spec must include:
- Prioritized user stories with Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- Numbered functional requirements (FR-NNN)
- Key entities involved
- Measurable success criteria (SC-NNN)
- Mark any ambiguities with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]

Feature to specify: $ARGUMENTS
